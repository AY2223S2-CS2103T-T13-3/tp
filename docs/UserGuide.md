Welcome to **sprINT's User Guide**. sprINT  is a **desktop application** for managing internship applications,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still incorporating the benefits of a Graphical User
Interface (GUI).

The app is optimized greatly for *fast typers*. If you can type fast, sprINT will be of great assistance in
your internship hunt!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `sprint.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your sprINT application.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar sprINT.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data already.<br>

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add r/SWE Intern c/Goggle e/goggle_careers@gmail.com s/interested d/01-01-2023` : Adds an
   application for Software Engineer Intern position @ Goggle that I'm interested in. Deadline of application is 1st of
   January.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add c/COMAPNY_NAME`, `COMPANY_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add c/John Doe's Company`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `c/COMPANY_NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `c/John Doe's Company t/highsalary` or as `c/John Doe's Company` only.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/highsalary`, `t/highsalary t/creditbearing` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `r/ROLE c/COMPANY_NAME`, `c/COMPANY_NAME r/ROLE` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `r/SWE Intern r/Software Intern`, only `r/Software Intern` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
