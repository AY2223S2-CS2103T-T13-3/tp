Welcome to *sprINT*!

**sprINT** is an **internship-tracking application** that was created to assist students in their internship hunt. Students often face a great administrative burden in keeping track of the high volume of job or internship applications, which include details like interview dates and Online Assessment links.

Therefore, our app aims to help these students by tracking and recording their application details, such as the company, contacts, status and deadlines.
