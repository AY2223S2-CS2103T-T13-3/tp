## **1. Introduction**

### 1.1 About sprINT 

**sprINT** is an **internship-tracking application** that was created to assist students in their internship hunt. 

Students often face a great administrative burden in keeping track of the high volume of job or internship 
applications. With sprINT, students can easily manage details of their internship applications, including the company, 
contacts, status and task deadlines.

### 1.2 About this guide

This developer guide details the high-level software architecture and design decisions for the implementation of sprINT.
It is intended for:

* Advanced users who wish to get a better understanding of sprINT's features
* Present and future developers, designers and testers of sprINT 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **2. Acknowledgements**

sprINT is adapted from the [AddressBook-Level3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/) 
project created by the SE-EDU initative.

## **4. Design**
### 4.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) 
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). 
It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-app 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 4.2 UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ApplicationListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### 4.3 Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `InternshipBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddApplicationCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete-app 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete-app 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` 
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `InternshipBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddApplicationCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddApplicationCommand`) which the `InternshipBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddApplicationCommandParser`, `DeleteApplicationCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### 4.4 Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Application` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueApplicationList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Application` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Application>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### 4.5 Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both internship book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `InternshipBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### 4.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **5. Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 5.1 Add Application feature

#### About
The add application command is a core feature of sprINT, allowing users to easily keep track of their internship
applications. By issuing the command with the appropriate prefixes, users can input the key details of their application,
including the role, company, email, and status. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** While `task` is also a field associated
with an application, users are only allowed to add a task to an application via the 
<a href="#56-add-task-feature">add task command</a>.</div>

With the add application command, users no longer have to rely on memory or scattered notes to keep track of their
applications. Instead, they can quickly and easily input all relevant information into sprINT, and access it at any
time to monitor their progress.

#### Usage
To add an application in sprINT, simply issue the command in the following format:

`add-app r/[role] c/[company name] e/[company email] s/[status]`

Here's a breakdown of what each prefix means:

- `r/` - indicates the role or position you're applying for in the internship application.
- `c/` - indicates the name of the company you're applying to for the internship.
- `e/` - indicates the email address of the company or the contact person you're communicating with regarding the application.
- `s/` - indicates the [status](#status) of your application.
- `t/` - indicates the tags that you want to associate with your application.

#### Implementation
The add application mechanism is facilitated by the Ui, Logic and Model components of sprINT. 

Given below are the steps that illustrate the interaction between the components when it receives a valid add
application command from the user.

1. The Ui component receives the user command from the `CommandBox` of sprINT's GUI.
2. The command is processed as a value of type `String`, and is passed to `ApplicationLogicManager` via its `execute()` method.
3. The `ApplicationLogicManager` passes the string input to the `InternshipBookParser` via the `parseCommand()` method.
4. The `InternshipBookParser` in turn creates an `AddApplicationCommandParser` that is responsible for the specific purpose of 
parsing user commands for adding applications.
5. The `InternshipBookParser` then passes the string input to the `AddApplicationCommandParser` via the `parse()` method.
6. The `AddApplicationCommandParser` then identifies the different prefixes in the string and creates the fields for the application.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The field entities that are minimally created include
the `Role`, `CompanyName`, `CompanyEmail` and `Status`. These also coincide with the compulsory fields that the user
must provide in the input when using the add application feature.</div>

7. These fields will then be used to create an `Application` instance.
8. The newly created `Application` instance will then be used to create an `AddApplicationCommand`. This command instances
is returned back to `ApplicationLogicManager`.
9. The `ApplicationLogicManager` then calls the `execute()` method of the `AddApplicationCommand`. This initializes the execution
the logic behind adding the associated application instance to the existing `InternshipBook`.
10. An instance of `CommandResult` is created which contains the information that will be displayed back to the User after
the execution of the command. 
11. The Ui component displays the contents of the `CommandResult` to the User.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The CommandResult will display the newly updated
application list to the User, should the add command execute successfully. If an error occurred during execution, the corresponding
exception that was thrown and the error message will be displayed to the user.</div>


For a more graphical illustration of how an add application command is processed, please refer to the following
sequence diagram:

![AddApplicationSequenceDiagram](images/AddApplicationSequenceDiagram.png)

### 5.2 Edit Application feature

#### About
The edit application command is another core feature of sprINT, similar to [add](#51-add-application-feature). Users 
can edit any field(s) of an existing application to update it or rectify input errors.

#### Usage
To edit an application in sprINT, simply issue the command in the following format:

`edit-app INDEX r/[role] c/[company name] e/[company email] s/[status]`

Apart from `INDEX`, all other fields are optional. However, at least one of the optional fields must be provided.

#### Implementation
The edit application mechanism is facilitated by the Ui, Logic and Model components of sprINT.

Given below are the steps that illustrate the interaction between the components when it receives a valid edit
application command from the user.

1. The Ui component receives the user command from the `CommandBox` of sprINT's GUI.
2. The command is processed as a value of type `String`, and is passed to `ApplicationLogicManager` via its `execute()` method.
3. The `ApplicationLogicManager` passes the string input to the `InternshipBookParser` via the `parseCommand()` method.
4. The `InternshipBookParser` in turn creates an `EditApplicationCommandParser` that is responsible for the specific purpose of
   parsing user commands for editing applications.
5. The `InternshipBookParser` then passes the string input to the `EditApplicationCommandParser` via the `parse()` method.
6. The `EditApplicationCommandParser` then identifies the input prefixes in the string and edits the fields for the application.
7. These fields will then be used to create an edited `Application` instance through `createEditedApplication` method.
8. The newly created `Application` instance will then be used to create an `EditApplicationCommand`. This command instances
   is returned back to `ApplicationLogicManager`.
9. The `ApplicationLogicManager` then calls the `execute()` method of the `EditApplicationCommand`. This initializes the execution
   the logic behind adding the associated application instance to the existing `InternshipBook`.
10. An instance of `CommandResult` is created which contains the information that will be displayed back to the User after
    the execution of the command.
11. The Ui component displays the contents of the `CommandResult` to the User.

For a more graphical illustration of how an edit application command is processed, please refer to the following
sequence diagram:

![EditApplicationSequenceDiagram](images/EditApplicationSequenceDiagram.png)


### 5.3 Find Application feature

#### About
The find command is a feature that enables users to search for a specific application within the internship book.

Users can locate the application by providing its index and optionally using the parameters `r/`, `c/`, and `s/` to 
refine their search. These parameters correspond to the role, company, and status fields in the internship book, 
allowing for customised searches. Without any of the required prefixes, it will do a global search for the
keyword in all fields of the applications.

#### Usage
To find an application in sprINT, issue the command in the following format:

`find [r/role] [c/companyName] [s/status]`

Here's a breakdown of what each prefix means:

- `r/` - finds the role or position of the application.
- `c/` - finds the company name of the application.
- `s/` - finds the status of the application. The only valid values are "interested", "applied", "rejected" and "offered".

#### Implementation
The find application mechanism is facilitated by the Ui, Logic and Model components of sprINT.

Given below are the steps that illustrate the interaction between the components when it receives a valid find 
command from the user.

1. The Ui component receives the user command from the `CommandBox` of sprINT's GUI.
2. The command is processed as a value of type `String`, and is passed to `ApplicationLogicManager` via its `execute()` method.
3. The `ApplicationLogicManager` passes the string input to the `InternshipBookParser` via the `parseCommand()` method.
4. The `InternshipBookParser` in turn creates an `FindApplicationCommandParser` that is responsible for the specific purpose of
   parsing user commands for finding applications.
5. The `InternshipBookParser` then passes the string input to the `FindApplicationCommandParser` via the `parse()` method.
6. The `FindApplicationCommandParser` then identifies the different prefixes (if any) in the string and creates a list of keywords.
7. The `parse()` method will return a `FindApplicationCommand(new NameContainsKeywordsPredicate(keywords))`.
8. This `FindApplicationCommand` is returned back to `ApplicationLogicManager`.
9. The `ApplicationLogicManager` then calls the `execute()` method of the `FindApplicationCommand`. This initializes the execution
   logic behind finding the associated application instance in the existing `InternshipBook`.
10. An instance of `CommandResult` is created which contains the information that will be displayed back to the User after
    the execution of the command.
11. The Ui component displays the contents of the `CommandResult` to the User.


For a more graphical illustration of how a find application command is processed, please refer to the following
sequence diagram:

![FindApplicationSequenceDiagram](images/FindApplicationSequenceDiagram.png)


### 5.4 Sort Applications feature

#### About
The sort command is a feature that enables users to rearrange the list of applications they see on the GUI in 2 ways:
- `sort deadline` will sort applications by the deadline of upcoming tasks in ascending order (i.e. from earliest 
to latest). 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Only applications that have a task 
associated will be displayed in the sorted list. Those without an associated task will **not** be shown.</div> 

- `sort alphabetical` will sort applications by the company name in ascending order. If there are two or more 
applications under the same company, the role will be used as a tiebreaker. 


#### Implementation
The sort application mechanism is facilitated by the Ui, Logic and Model components of sprINT.

Given below are the steps that illustrate the interaction between the components when it receives a valid sort
command from the user.

1. The Ui component receives the user command from the `CommandBox` of sprINT's GUI.
2. The command is processed as a value of type `String`, and is passed to `ApplicationLogicManager` via its `execute()` method.
3. The `ApplicationLogicManager` passes the string input to the `InternshipBookParser` via the `parseCommand()` method.
4. The `InternshipBookParser` in turn creates an `SortApplicationCommandParser` that is responsible for the specific purpose of
   parsing user commands for sorting the application list.
5. The `InternshipBookParser` then passes the string input to the `SortApplicationCommandParser` via the `parse()` method.
6. The `SortApplicationCommandParser` then identifies the part of the string that describes the sorting order the user wants.
7. The `parse()` method will return a `SortApplicationCommand(String sortingOrder)`.
8. The `isValidSortingOrder` method in `SortApplicationCommand` will then check that the user-inputted sorting order is one
of the accepted sorting order as dictated by the enum values in enum `SortingOrder`.
9. If the sorting order is valid, the `SortApplicationCommand`'s comparator will be set to the corresponding comparator.
10. This `SortApplicationCommand` is returned back to `ApplicationLogicManager`.
11. The `ApplicationLogicManager` then calls the `execute()` method of the `SortApplicationCommand`. This initializes the execution
    logic behind modifying the existing sorted list in `InternshipBook`, by calling the method `updateSortedApplicationList` in `ApplicationLogicManager`.
12. `updateSortedApplicationList` will make use of the comparator from the `SortApplicationCommand` to sort the model's sorted list.
13. The model's sorted list is then passed to the UI to be shown to the user on the GUI.
14. An instance of `CommandResult` is also created which contains the information that will be displayed back to the User after
    the execution of the command.
15. The Ui component displays the contents of the `CommandResult` to the User.

For a more graphical illustration of how a sort application command is processed, please refer to the following
sequence diagram:

![SortApplicationSequenceDiagram](images/SortApplicationSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Future extensions
Should the need to implement other ways of sorting the application list arise in the future, you can do so by following these 3 main steps:
1. Create a new `Comparator` class not dissimilar to `AlphabeticalComparator` and `DeadlineComparator` that
implements the `Comparator<Application>` interface.
2. Modify `SortApplicationCommandParser` to accept a new sorting order.
3. Modify `SortApplicationCommand`. Specifically, its enum class `SortingOrder` should be expanded to accept a new enum values for your new sorting order.
Also, modify its constructor so that it can create a comparator of the newly created `Comparator` class for `SortApplicationCommand`.

#### Relation with `list` command
The implementation of the `sort` command shares some similarities with the `list` command.
The `list` command lists all applications in the order of creation; i.e., applications that are more recently added
will be shown higher up in the list.
The execution of these commands is essentially a two-step process of first **filtering** and then **storing**: 
1. `ApplicationLogicManager` takes the internal list that keeps track of all the applications. It stores a **filtered** version of this
list in `FilteredList`.
2. `ApplicationLogicManager` takes the `FilteredList` and stores a **sorted** version of this list in `SortedList`.

See the following activity diagram that illustrates this workflow with some example executions of the `sort`, `find`
and `list` commands:

![CommandExecutionWorkflow](images/CommandExecutionWorkflow.png)

### 5.5 Undo/redo feature

#### About

The undo/redo command is a feature that helps to enhance users' experience. The undo command allows users to backtrack
and reverse their previous action, while the redo command allows users to reapply any changes they have undone. 

#### Usage

To undo or redo the previous command, simply issue the command `undo` or `redo` respectively.

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedInternshipBook`. It extends `InternshipBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `internshipBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedInternshipBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current internship book state in its history.
* `VersionedInternshipBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous internship book state from its history.
* `VersionedInternshipBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone internship book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitInternshipBook()`, `Model#undoInternshipBook()` and `Model#redoInternshipBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedInternshipBook` will be initialized with the initial internship book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single internship book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th application in the internship book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitInternshipBook()`, causing the modified state of the internship book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `internshipBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted internship book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add-app c/Google â€¦â€‹` to add a new application. The `add-app` command also calls `Model#commitInternshipBook()`, causing another modified internship book state to be saved into the `internshipBookStateList`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will 
not call `Model#commitInternshipBook()`, so the internship book state will not be saved into the 
`internshipBookStateList`.</div>

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The command shown in the diagram above 
is shortened for brevity. For the complete correct syntax, please refer to the <a href="#51-add-application-feature">add-application</a> section.</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the application was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing 
the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoInternshipBook()`, which will shift the 
`currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous internship book state, and restores the
internship book to that state.


![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, 
pointing to the initial InternshipBook state, then there are no previous InternshipBook states to restore. The `undo` 
command uses `Model#canUndoInternshipBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.</div>

The following sequence diagram provides a graphical illustration of how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoInternshipBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the internship book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 
`internshipBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest internship book state, then there are no undone 
InternshipBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoInternshipBook()` to check if this is the case. 
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the internship book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitInternshipBook()`, `Model#undoInternshipBook()` or `Model#redoInternshipBook()`. Thus, the `internshipBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitInternshipBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `internshipBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add-app c/Google â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behaviour that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire internship book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the company being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### 5.6 Add Task feature 

#### About

The add task command is a feature that allows users to add a [task](#task) to an existing application in the 
internship book. This allows users to keep track of additional requirements for an application that other fields 
may not be able to capture adequately.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Currently, sprINT only supports adding 
**one** task per application. This means that users will **not** be allowed to add more tasks to an application that 
already has an existing task associated with it.</div>

#### Usage

To add a task to an existing application in sprINT, simply issue the command in the following format:
`add-task INDEX d/[description] by/[deadline]`

Here's a breakdown of what each prefix means:
* `d/` - indicates the description of the task.
* `by/` - indicates the deadline of the task, in `DD-MM-YYYY` format. 


#### Implementation

The add task mechanism is facilitated by the Ui, Logic and Model components of sprINT. Although it has its own parser 
class (`AddTaskCommandParser`), the steps taken when it receives a valid add task command from the user are largely 
similar to the [edit application](#52-edit-application-feature) command, since the add task feature uses existing logic
from `EditApplicationCommand` under the hood (for why this is the case, refer to 
[Design Considerations](#design-considerations)).

The following sequence diagram provides a graphical illustration of how the add task operation works:

![AddTaskSequenceDiagram](images/AddTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How `add task` executes**
  
* **Option 1** (Current design): Use existing logic from the `EditApplicationCommand` class (i.e. 
  `createEditedApplication` and `EditApplicationDescriptor`).
  * Pros:
    * Reduces duplicate code (and thus code redundancy).
    * Makes sense from a logical perspective: since `Task` is implemented as just another field in `Application`, 
      _adding a task_ to an application is essentially just another interface for _editing_ the application.
  * Cons:
    * Increases coupling between `AddTaskCommand` and `EditApplicationCommand`.

* **Option 2**: Implement logic for `createEditedApplication` and `EditApplicationDescriptor` **within** the 
    `AddTaskCommand` class.
    * Pros:
      * Reduces coupling between `AddTaskCommand` and `EditApplicationCommand`.
    * Cons:
      * Increases code redundancy.
      * Violates Single Responsibility Principle.


### 5.7 Exit sprINT feature

#### About

The exit command allows users to close the desktop application safely, terminating any running processes and freeing up
system resources. With this feature, users can efficiently exit the application without any risk of data loss or 
system instability. This action serves the same purpose as closing the application window by clicking the top-right 
X button.

#### Usage

To exit sprINT, simply issue the command `exit` or click on the X button on the top-right of the application window.

#### Implementation
1. The Ui component receives the user command from the `CommandBox` of sprINT's GUI.
2. The command is processed as a value of type string, and is passed to `ApplicationLogicManager` via it's `execute()` method.
3. The `ApplicationLogicManager` passes the string input to the `InternshipBookParser` via the `parseCommand()` method.
4. Upon parsing the `exit` Command Keyword, the `InternshipBookParser` creates a `ExitSprintCommand`. This command instance
   is returned back to `ApplicationLogicManager`.
5. The `ApplicationLogicManager` then calls the `execute()` method of the `ExitSprintCommand`.
6. An instance of `CommandResult` is created and returned to the Ui component.
7. The Ui component detects the `CommandResult` initiated from an `ExitSprintCommand`, and then handles the closure
   of the desktop application.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** All `CommandResult` instances have an
`exit` boolean field. The boolean value indicates whether the CommandResult corresponds to that of an `exit` command.
This is what allows the Ui Component, `MainWindow`, to detect that a request to close the application has been issued
from the user.

* **Interested**: An internship that the user is interested in, but has yet to apply to.
* **Applied**: An internship that the user has applied to, but has yet to receive an offer or rejection for.
* **Offered**: An internship that the user has received an offer for.
* **Rejected**: An internship that the user has been rejected for.

#### Task 
Represents additional milestones that are part of the internship application process. Examples include online 
assessment, technical interview, etc.
