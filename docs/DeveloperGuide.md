## **1. Introduction**

### 1.1 About sprINT 

**sprINT** is an **internship-tracking application** that was created to assist students in their internship hunt. 

Students often face a great administrative burden in keeping track of the high volume of job or internship 
applications. With sprINT, students can easily manage details of their internship applications, including the company, 
contacts, status and task deadlines.

### 1.2 About this guide

This developer guide details the high-level software architecture and design decisions for the implementation of sprINT.
It is intended for:

* Advanced users who wish to get a better understanding of sprINT's features
* Present and future developers, designers and testers of sprINT 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **2. Acknowledgements**

sprINT is adapted from the [AddressBook-Level3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/) 
project created by the SE-EDU initative.

## **4. Design**
### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-app 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ApplicationListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `InternshipBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddApplicationCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete-app 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete-app 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` 
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `InternshipBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddApplicationCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddApplicationCommand`) which the `InternshipBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddApplicationCommandParser`, `DeleteApplicationCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Application` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueApplicationList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Application` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Application>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both internship book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `InternshipBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Application feature

#### About
The add application command is a core feature of sprINT, allowing users to easily keep track of their internship
applications. By issuing the command with the appropriate prefixes, users can input the key details of their application,
including the role, company, email, and status.

With the add application command, users no longer have to rely on memory or scattered notes to keep track of their
applications. Instead, they can quickly and easily input all relevant information into sprINT, and access it at any
time to monitor their progress.

#### Usage
To use the add application command in sprINT, simply issue the command in the following format:

add r/[role] c/[company name] e/[company email] s/[status]

Here's a breakdown of what each prefix means:

- `r/` - this prefix is used to indicate the role or position you're applying for in the internship application.
- `c/` - this prefix is used to indicate the name of the company you're applying to for the internship.
- `e/` - this prefix is used to indicate the email address of the company or the contact person you're communicating with regarding the application.
- `s/` - this prefix is used to indicate the status of your application, such as "interested", "applied", "rejected", or "offered".
- `t/` - this prefix is used to indicate the tags that you want to associate with your application.

#### Implementation
The add application mechanism is facilitated by the Ui, Logic and Model components of sprINT. 

Given below are the steps that illustrate the interaction between the components when it receives a valid add
application command from the user.

1. The Ui component receives the user command from the `CommandBox` of sprINT's GUI.
2. The command is processed as a value of type string, and is passed to `ApplicationLogicManager` via it's `execute()` method.
3. The `ApplicationLogicManager` passes the string input to the `InternshipBookParser` via the `parseCommand()` method.
4. The `InternshipBookParser` in turn creates an `AddApplicationCommandParser` that is responsible for the specific purpose of 
parsing user commands for adding applications.
5. The `InternshipBookParser` then passes the string input to the `AddApplicationCommandParser` via the `parse()` method.
6. The `AddApplicationCommandParser` then identifies the different prefixes in the string and creates the fields for the application.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The field entities that are minimally created include
the `Role`, `CompanyName`, `CompanyEmail` and `Status`. These also coincide with the compulsory fields that the user
must provide in the input when using the add application feature.

</div>   

7. These fields will then be used to create an `Application` instance.
8. The newly created `Application` instance will then be used to create an `AddApplicationCommand`. This command instances
is returned back to `ApplicationLogicManager`.
9. The `ApplicationLogicManager` then calls the `execute()` method of the `AddApplicationCommand`. This initializes the execution
the logic behind adding the associated application instance to the existing `InternshipBook`.
10. An instance of `CommandResult` is created which contains the information that will be displayed back to the User after
the execution of the command. 
11. The Ui component displays the contents of the `CommandResult` to the User.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The CommandResult will display the newly updated
application list to the User, should the add command execute successfully. If an error occurred during execution, the corresponding
exception that was thrown and the error message will be displayed to the user.

</div> 

For a more graphical illustration of how an add application command is processed, please refer to the following
sequence diagram:

![AddApplicationSequenceDiagram](images/AddApplicationSequenceDiagram.png)


### Edit Application feature

#### About
The edit application command is another core feature of sprINT, similar to add. User can edit existing application to reflect their latest status of the application, or to rectify input errors.
Old values will be changed to the new input values.


#### Usage
To use the edit application command in sprINT, simply issue the command in the following format:

edit INDEX r/[role] c/[company name] e/[company email] s/[status]

Apart from INDEX, all fields are optional. However, at least one of the optional fields must be provided.

Here's a breakdown of what each prefix means:

- `INDEX`  The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed application list. The index must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, â€¦â€‹
- `r/` - this prefix is used to indicate the role or position you're applying for in the internship application.
- `c/` - this prefix is used to indicate the name of the company you're applying to for the internship.
- `e/` - this prefix is used to indicate the email address of the company or the contact person you're communicating with regarding the application.
- `s/` - this prefix is used to indicate the status of your application, such as "interested", "applied", "rejected", or "offered".
- `t/` - this prefix is used to indicate the tags that you want to associate with your application.

#### Implementation
The edit application mechanism is facilitated by the Ui, Logic and Model components of sprINT.

Given below are the steps that illustrate the interaction between the components when it receives a valid edit
application command from the user.

1. The Ui component receives the user command from the `CommandBox` of sprINT's GUI.
2. The command is processed as a value of type string, and is passed to `ApplicationLogicManager` via it's `execute()` method.
3. The `ApplicationLogicManager` passes the string input to the `InternshipBookParser` via the `parseCommand()` method.
4. The `InternshipBookParser` in turn creates an `EditApplicationCommandParser` that is responsible for the specific purpose of
   parsing user commands for editing applications.
5. The `InternshipBookParser` then passes the string input to the `EditApplicationCommandParser` via the `parse()` method.
6. The `EditApplicationCommandParser` then identifies the input prefixes in the string and edits the fields for the application.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The field entities that are minimally created include
the `Role`, `CompanyName`, `CompanyEmail` and `Status`. These also coincide with the compulsory fields that the user
must provide in the input when using the add application feature.

</div>   

7. These fields will then be used to create an edited `Application` instance through `createEditedApplication` method.
8. The newly created `Application` instance will then be used to create an `EditApplicationCommand`. This command instances
   is returned back to `ApplicationLogicManager`.
9. The `ApplicationLogicManager` then calls the `execute()` method of the `EditApplicationCommand`. This initializes the execution
   the logic behind adding the associated application instance to the existing `InternshipBook`.
10. An instance of `CommandResult` is created which contains the information that will be displayed back to the User after
    the execution of the command.
11. The Ui component displays the contents of the `CommandResult` to the User.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The CommandResult will display the newly updated
application list to the User, should the edit command execute successfully. If an error occurred during execution, the corresponding
exception that was thrown and the error message will be displayed to the user.

</div> 

For a more graphical illustration of how an edit application command is processed, please refer to the following
sequence diagram:

![EditApplicationSequenceDiagram](images/EditApplicationSequenceDiagram.png)


### Find Application feature

#### About
The "find" command is a tool that enables users to search for a specific application within the internship book.

Users can locate the application by providing its index and optionally using the parameters "r/", "c/", and "s/" to 
refine their search. These parameters correspond to the role, company, and status fields in the internship book
, allowing for customized searches. Without any of the required prefixes, it will do a global search for the search
keyword in all fields of the applications.

#### Usage
To find an application in sprINT, issue the command in the following format:

`find [r/role] [c/companyName] [s/status]`

Here's a breakdown of what each prefix means:

- `r/` - this prefix is used to find role or position in the internship application.
- `c/` - this prefix is used to find the company name in the internship.
- `s/` - this prefix is used to find the status of your application, such as "interested", "applied", "rejected", or "offered".

#### Implementation
The find application mechanism is facilitated by the Ui, Logic and Model components of sprINT.

Given below are the steps that illustrate the interaction between the components when it receives a valid add
application command from the user.

1. The Ui component receives the user command from the `CommandBox` of sprINT's GUI.
2. The command is processed as a value of type string, and is passed to `ApplicationLogicManager` via it's `execute()` method.
3. The `ApplicationLogicManager` passes the string input to the `InternshipBookParser` via the `parseCommand()` method.
4. The `InternshipBookParser` in turn creates an `FindApplicationCommandParser` that is responsible for a specific purpose of
   parsing user commands for adding applications.
5. The `InternshipBookParser` then passes the string input to the `FindApplicationCommandParser` via the `parse()` method.
6. The `FindApplicationCommandParser` then identifies the different prefixes (if any) in the string and creates a list of keywords.
7. The `parse()` method will return a `FindApplicationCommand(new NameContainsKeywordsPredicate(keywords))`.
8. This `FindApplicationCommand` is returned back to `ApplicationLogicManager`.
9. The `ApplicationLogicManager` then calls the `execute()` method of the `FindApplicationCommand`. This initializes the execution
   the logic behind adding the associated application instance to the existing `InternshipBook`.
10. An instance of `CommandResult` is created which contains the information that will be displayed back to the User after
    the execution of the command.
11. The Ui component displays the contents of the `CommandResult` to the User.

For a more graphical illustration of how an add application command is processed, please refer to the following
sequence diagram:

![FindApplicationSequenceDiagram](images/FindApplicationSequenceDiagram.png)

### \[In Progress\] Sort feature

#### About
sprINT offers the options to sort the applications list in two ways:
- `sort deadline` will sort by the deadline of upcoming tasks
- `sort alphabetical` will sort by the alphabetical order of the internship roles; if there are two internship roles
that are the same, the tiebreaker will be the alphabetical order of the company name

#### Implementation
_to be added_

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### Add Task feature

#### Description

The `add-task` command allows users to add a task to an existing application in the internship book, specified by
its index, with the parameters `description` and `deadline`. 

#### Implementation

The following sequence diagram illustrates how sprINT's internal components interact with one another in response 
to the `add-task` command.

<img src="images/AddTaskSequenceDiagram.png" />

When a user enters the `add-task` command: 
1. The `parse` method of `AddTaskCommandParser` is invoked.
   1. The target application's `index`, along with the `deadline` and `description` fields for the new task,
      are extracted from the command string. 
   2. A new `EditApplicationDescriptor` object, which stores details about the new task for the target application,
      is created. 
   3. A new `AddTaskCommand` object containing the target application's `index` and the aforementioned `descriptor` 
      is created.
2. The newly created `AddTaskCommand` object is then executed. 
   1. The `createEditedApplication` method of the `EditApplicationCommand` class is invoked to create a new 
       application with the task added. This represents the edited application.
   2. This `editedApplication` object replaces the existing `Application` object in the model. 

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How `add task` executes**
  
* **Option 1** (Current design): use existing logic from the `EditApplicationCommand` class (i.e. 
  `createEditedApplication` and `EditApplicationDescriptor`)
  * Pros:
    * Reduces duplicate code (and thus code redundancy).
    * Makes sense from a logical perspective: since `Task` is implemented as just another field in `Application`, 
      _adding a task_ to an application is essentially just another interface for _editing_ the application.
  * Cons:
    * Increases coupling between `AddTaskCommand` and `EditApplicationCommand`.

* **Option 2**: implement logic for `createEditedApplication` and `EditApplicationDescriptor` **within** the 
    `AddTaskCommand` class
    * Pros:
      * Reduces coupling between `AddTaskCommand` and `EditApplicationCommand`.
    * Cons:
      * Increases code redundancy.
      * Violates Single Responsibility Principle.

### Clear Applications Feature

#### About

The clear applications command is a feature in sprINT. This command allows users to remove all previously inserted
applications from the system, providing a fresh start for new application entries. With this feature, users can
easily reset their application history and begin again with a clean slate.

#### Usage

To use the clear applications command, simply enter `clear` in the command line interface. Upon executing the command,
sprINT will remove all previously inserted applications from the system, leaving a blank slate for the user to begin anew.
It is important to note that this action cannot be undone, so use this command with caution. This feature is especially
useful for users who have completed their internships or want to start afresh with a new internship cycle.
With the clear applications command, sprINT provides an efficient and simple way to manage internship applications.

#### Implementation

The find application mechanism is facilitated by the Ui, Logic and Model components of sprINT.

Given below are the steps that illustrate the interaction between the components when it receives a valid add
application command from the user.

1. The Ui component receives the user command from the `CommandBox` of sprINT's GUI.
2. The command is processed as a value of type string, and is passed to `ApplicationLogicManager` via it's `execute()` method.
3. The `ApplicationLogicManager` passes the string input to the `InternshipBookParser` via the `parseCommand()` method.
4. Upon parsing the `clear` Command Keyword, the `InternshipBookParser` creates a `ClearApplicationsCommand`. This command instance
   is returned back to `ApplicationLogicManager`.
5. The `ApplicationLogicManager` then calls the `execute()` method of the `ClearApplicationsCommand`. This initializes the execution
   the logic behind resetting the entire `InternshipBook`.
6. An instance of `CommandResult` is created which contains the information that will be displayed back to the User after
   the execution of the command.
7. The Ui component displays the contents of the `CommandResult` to the User.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `clear` command executed successfully,
the CommandResult will display the newly updated application list to the user, which would be empty in this case.
If an error occurred during execution, the corresponding exception that was thrown and the error message will be displayed to the user.
</div> 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The `clear` command must be used with
extreme caution, as it might potentially lead to highly undesirable outcomes. As a safety precaution, we do not delete
the original instance of the `InternshipBook` immediately after executing a `clear` command. Users will have the
opportunity to revert back to the previous state using the `undo` command.
</div> 

For a more graphical illustration of how a clear application command is processed, please refer to the following
sequence diagram:

![ClearApplicationsSequenceDiagram](images/ClearApplicationsSequenceDiagram.png)


### Exit SprINT

#### About

The exit command is a feature in sprINT. This command allows users to close the desktop application safely,
terminating any running processes and freeing up system resources. With this feature, users can efficiently exit
the application without any risk of data loss or system instability.

#### Usage

To use the exit command, simply enter `exit` in the command line interface. Upon executing the command, sprINT will
safely close the desktop application, freeing up any system resources used by the program. Since SprINT saves data
and changes upon each received user command, Users do not have to worry about unsaved or possible loss of data
when exiting sprINT.

#### Implementation
1. The Ui component receives the user command from the `CommandBox` of sprINT's GUI.
2. The command is processed as a value of type string, and is passed to `ApplicationLogicManager` via it's `execute()` method.
3. The `ApplicationLogicManager` passes the string input to the `InternshipBookParser` via the `parseCommand()` method.
4. Upon parsing the `exit` Command Keyword, the `InternshipBookParser` creates a `ExitSprintCommand`. This command instance
   is returned back to `ApplicationLogicManager`.
5. The `ApplicationLogicManager` then calls the `execute()` method of the `ExitSprintCommand`.
6. An instance of `CommandResult` is created and returned to the Ui component.
7. The Ui component detects the `CommandResult` initiated from an `ExitSprintCommand`, and then handles the closure
   of the desktop application.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** All `CommandResult` instances have an
`exit` boolean field. The boolean value indicates whether the CommandResult corresponds to that of an `exit` command.
This is what allows the Ui Component, `MainWindow`, to detect that a request to close the application has been issued
from the user.
</div> 

For a more graphical illustration of how an exit application command is processed, please refer to the following
sequence diagram:

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2. Should take less than 500MB of memory while in operation.
3. Should be able to view all (up to 1500) application entries on the homepage interface without noticeable lags.
4. Will not perform any automated tasks e.g., send periodic reminders. Hence, sprINT will not have a server component.
5. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
